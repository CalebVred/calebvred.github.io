Hello! My name is Caleb Vredevoogd and I am a Computer Science student at
Calvin University. This blog is pretty experimental right now: I'm trying to add
features like comments, share buttons, etc.

As for content, I'm not going to focus on a specific theme right now, so I'll be
posting about tech, gaming, cooking or whatever seems appropriate. I don't have
a regular schedule, but hopefully once I have this running that will change.

If this blog gets big enough I will try to monetize it.
