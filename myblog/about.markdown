Hello! My name is Caleb Vredevoogd and I am a Computer Science student at
Calvin University. I have a wide range of software development experience. While I spend most of my free time coding in Python, I've had professional experience writing C code for embedded systems like the Raspberry Pi.

On that note, I've also had a lot of professional and personal experience dealing with Linux. It's been my go-to system for daily driving. I'm currently using Pop! OS on my laptop.

This blog will host updates on current projects as well as maybe some reviews. I've been doing a bit of book reading, game playing, movie watching and music listening, so depending on how active I am on this blog you'll hear more thoughts on that as well. I have only a couple of posts right now, but hopefully more will come.
