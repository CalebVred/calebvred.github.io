# A Forkfull of IoT Fun

When I was thinking about this project, I was worried about how long it would take and how hard it would be to eventually get a working mobile/web frontend to control something working on the Raspberry Pi. Lo and Behold, a simple internet search of "best way for user to interface with raspberry pi over smartphone" yielded [this medium post](https://medium.com/cortico/controlling-a-raspberry-pi-with-a-phone-15cb374535e7) which led me to a [repository](https://github.com/CorticoAI/raspberrypi-iot) that should ideally do everything I want it to, with some modifications.
