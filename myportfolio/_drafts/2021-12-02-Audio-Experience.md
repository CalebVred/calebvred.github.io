# Ambient Audio Mobile App

My last [project](./2021-11-12-Good-Morning-From-Raspberry-Pi.markdown) has been delayed for lack of a secondary WI-FI adapter to create a hotspot on the Raspberry Pi. No worries, I have another idea.

Need to re-familiarize with using React Native - shamelessly using sample code.
Stopwatch timer [code found here](https://github.com/michaeljstevens/react-native-stopwatch-timer#readme). 
Idea is to mimick The Long Dark soundtrack with the very base idea of a random timer that plays ambient jingles. Further down the line I want to add location-based triggers.

Sample code is helpful. 

UPDATE: react-native-stopwatch-timer is about to be deprecated and is not well maintained!
